                    <h4>Instructions</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Put all ingredients, in the order listed, into the bread machine pan. Start the dough
                            setting. This should take around 1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mix only 1 egg into the dough mixture. The other egg will be used for the egg wash.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Remove the dough from the bread machine and place on a baking sheet with parchment paper with
                        some flour.</li>
                        <li>Stretch the bread out into a square and let the dough sit for 10 minutes to allow the yeast to
                        settle.</li>
                        <li>Slice the dough into 3 evenly-sized pieces.</li>
                        <li>Stretch and pull each piece into 13” long pieces and place side by side.</li>
                        <li>Get ready to braid! Cynthia Maynard has a challah making video that explains it better than I
                        can type it. Here is the braiding process.</li>
                        <li>Proof your braid for about 45 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Prepare your egg wash. Grab the 1 egg and separate the white and the yolk. Mix the yolk with
                        about 2 tablespoons of water.</li>
                        <li>After your dough is proofed, use a brush to coat the loaf with your egg wash. Get all the
                        crevices! Optional: Add any additional topping. I added pink himalayan salt and sesame seeds.</li>
                        <li>Bake in the oven at 375° F for 25 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Tap test! The bread will be a golden brown and the real test is tapping the top of the loaf. You
                        should hear a hollow sound. Enjoy!</li>

                <h3>Apple Hand Pies</h3>
                <div class="container width-600 center">
                    <div>5 Apples</div>
                    <div>Peel and dice the apples into small bite-sized chunks</div>
                    <div>Unsalted Butter, 3 tbsp</div>
                    <div>In a skillet, melt the butter over medium heat, then add the apples, tossing to coat them in the butter.</div>
                    <div>1 tsp Lemon juice <br> 1 tsp Lemon zest <br> 1 tsp Vanilla extract</div>
                    <div>Add lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla. Cook, stirring constantly for 5 minutes until the apples begin to soften.</div>
                    <div>2 tbsp water <br> 2 tbsp corn starch</div>
                    <div>Make a cornstarch slurry. Cook for an additional 3 minutes until softened. Then, turn off the heat and set it aside to cool.</div>
                    <div>Puff pastry</div>
                    <div>Preheat the oven to 375°F. <br>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. <br>Use a sharp knife to cut your puff pastry into 8 equal pieces. <br>Place the pieces on the lined baking sheet.</div>
                    <div>Egg</div>
                    <div>Add a spoonful or two of the cooled apple filling onto each piece of puff pastry. Fold it over and seal with the tines of a fork. Create 3 small slits at the top and brush with a beaten egg.</div>
                    <div>Cinnamon sugar</div>
                    <div>Bake the hand pies for 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle the top of each pie with cinnamon sugar while they are still warm.</div>
