<h2>Who is Gingy?</h2>
<p>Gingy is a Gingerbread person created by the Muffin Man. He made his first appearance in the film, Shrek (2002): biscuit brown, white icing, gumdrop buttons, and that<em> damn</em> smile.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingerbread_man">Wikipedia</a>, while gingerbread and figurative biscuitmaking dates back between the 15th and 16th century, the court of Elizabeth I of England were witnesses to the first documented instance of figure-shaped gingerbread biscuits. The cookies were shaped and presented in the likeness of some of her important guests which brought the humanoid shape of the gingerbread.</p>
